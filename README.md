# Web APIs Coding Quiz Homework Assignment

## What I attempted to do:

Create a coding quiz that begins once the start button is clicked. The start button displays the first question and activates a timer. After an answer is selected for a question, the next question is displayed. If an incorrect answer is selected, time is subtracted from the timer. User selections are validated against this criteria and a password is generated and displayed based on the user's selectionsThe game is over when all the questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0. When the game is over, the player is asked to enter their initials and click a save button to see their score.
